\section{A Minimum Viable Language Textbook}
\label{sec:system}

Our long term vision, of an ecosystem where various educational applications, created by different authors, interacting and sharing information in order to maximize the efficiency and enjoyment of the vocabulary learning process is described in more detail elsewhere \cite{Lungu16}. 

Figure \ref{fig:architecture} highlights two types of applications that are relevant for implementing a language textbook: {\bf reader applications} allow the learners to interact with texts in their preferred context (e.g. eBooks, News, Blogs) and {\bf vocabulary trainers} allow the readers to practice vocabulary exercises.

\end{figure}

\begin{added}

	Besides the applicatins, Figure \ref{fig:architecture} presents three critical components of the ecosystem, which are at the core of the system which can interact with various applications: the learner model, translation service, and the study recommender. We briefly describe each in turn. 
	
\end{added}

\subsection{Learner Model}

The basic idea, sketched in Figure \ref{fig:architecture}, is that at the core of the ecosystem a ``learner model'' tracks the evolving knowledge of the learner. Based on this it can make recommendations to the individual applications. The individual applications, in turn, report back to the learner model events from which the learner progress can be infered. 


\subsection{Translator Service}

The core API of the ecosystem provides translations. It is critical that the translation service is used by all the applications in the ecosystem since this allows the server to track the words and the context in which they are being looked up. This information is then used for estimating learner knowledge and for generating personalized recommendations. 

The Translation Service is an API implemented using Python. Instead of implementing our own contextual translation engine, we decided to rely on existing industrial grade translation APIs. To avoid depending on a single service and to also increase the likelihood that at least one of the alternative translations is the correct one, the translation service dispatches in parallel requests to at least three third party translation APIs: Google Translate, Microsoft Translate, and Glosbe. \cite{Jager17-mux} The first two provide contextual translations and multi-word translations, while the third is a simple dictionary. 

The dependency of the translation service on multiple third party APIs allows for a higher reliability and a chance to guarantee a low response time: when a service is down or too slow to respond, the results from it are ignored. We detail elsewhere the strategies we use to keep response times low\cite{Jager17-mux}.

% by interacting with a core API that provides the basic contextual translations, user knowledge estimation, and recommendations for words to be studied and texts to be read \cite{Lungu16}. 

\subsection{Study Recommender}

The scheduling algorithm is based on an adaptive, response-time-based scheduling algorithm [was developed] to increase the efficiency of perceptual learning by Mettler et al. \cite{Mettler14-ARTS}. After evaluating several alternative scheduling strategies we settled on the Mettler one since it has been proven to have gains with both familiar, seen items as well as with new, unseen instances and the benefits of adaptive scheduling were present at an immediate test as well as at a delay \cite{Mettler14-ARTS}.


\subsection{Web-Based Reader and Trainer Applications}


Before we convince other application creators to join such an ecosystem, we have decided to build a {\em minimum viable ecosystem} which includes the basic implementations of the core components. 

The system that we present in this paper as a {\em personalized language textbook} is composed of instantiations of the components. We present them in turn in this section, focusing the discussion on three key activities that a user of such an interactive textbook is interested in: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item finding texts to read
	\item reading the found texts
	\item doing vocabulary exercises
\end{enumerate}

 % interacts with: the reader and the trainer applications. 
\begin{added}
	
	The system presented is implemented as a responsive web application, and thus can be used from a variety of devices. In our experiments it was used from Windows, Android, and iOS devices.
