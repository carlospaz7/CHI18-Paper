\section{The Students}

The population that we tested our infrastructure with represent \stcnt highschool students from Groningen in the Netherlands. Their native language is Dutch and most of them speak fluent English. 

We deployed the system with the translations in English instead of Dutch and we made it clear to the students that if for some of them this is insufficient, 

Their ages vary between ... and ... 

Their self declared language level is presented in the table below: 

At the begining of June, we visited the school, and we introduced the
way the infrastructure is to be used during one hour. 

The system was to be used until June 28th. 

The teacher asked the students to be using the infrastructure and write reports on the way they used. For evey half an hour of usage, the students would have to write a brief report that they would submit to the teacher about how they spent their time.
