\section{How Do Students Use the Possibility of Reading Personally Interesting Articles?}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection {Feed Subscriptions}
Figure \ref{fig:registrations} represents an incidence matrix collected at the end of the study interval: the columns represent students, and the rows represent article sources; if a student is registered to a given source, at the intersection of the corresponding row and column we place a $\Diamond$. 

We would expect to see fully continuous horizontal rows of data-points if every user subscribed to the same feed, and fully continuous vertical rows if every user subscribed to all of the feeds available. The fact that these patterns are largely absent in Figure 4 supports our assumption that different individuals prefer to subscribe to different reading sources.

% The figure illustrates that giving the students the freedom to choose the sources they wanted, allowed each one of them to express their interest. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/users_feeds}
  \caption{Different users subscribe to different sources}~\label{fig:registrations}
\end{figure}

Of course some feeds are more popular than others. Projecting the data- points onto the horizontal axis and sorting the results leaves us with a histogram as can be seen in Figure 5.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/feed_popularity}
  \caption{Some feeds are more popular than others}~\label{fig:registrations}
\end{figure}


{\em 1Jour1Actu} is the most popular article source and Le Figaro - Sant\'e is the least. In order to see whether or not this might be related to how they are presented in the dialog window of our system (see Figure \ref{fig:system_subscriptions}), we can compare the order of popularity with the order in which they are displayed. One can see how the second-to-last presented feed, Le Monde, is the second most popular feed by measure of subscriptions. Conversely, the feed listed above Le Monde is actually the least subscribed-to feed in our listing.

\end{figure}




\subsection{Article Interactions}
Figure \ref{fig:articles_read} shows that the articles that the users interact with present a similar pattern: each user explores their own interest, and there is no one article that is interesting for all. The vertical ``line '' in the figure represents an over-active reader.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/users_articles}
  \caption{Every student has their own article reading preferences}~\label{fig:articles_read}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Feature Usage}
\newcommand{\feature}[1]{{\em #1}}
We tracked the usage of the various features in the interactive reader through a telemetry system that records all the interactions with a set of interactive elements of interest. Telemetry is being used increasingly in game design \cite{Gagne11-telemetry} but also in other contexts as a method of user behavior analysis. 

Based on logging every interaction of every user, Figure \ref{fig:feature_usage} shows the six most used features of the system.\footnote{An extended analysisÂ that includes more features is presented elsewhere \cite{Chirtoaca17-apollo}}

  \begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{figures/reader_feature_usage}
    \caption{Popularity of features by their recorded usage-events}
    \label{fig:feature_usage}
  \end{figure}

With 6.700 occurrences, \feature{requesting a translation for a word} is the most used interactive feature of the system. The second most used feature is \feature{opening the translation alternatives} drop-down list. The six-to-one ration between the two features is an indicator of the limitations of the automatic translation -- it seems that one in six translations are not satisfying to the learners.

The third most used feature is \feature{pronounciation}. On average, there are about 1.66 pronunciations for a given translation, suggesting that users are often asking for a second pronunciation after hearing it the first time. 

% \ml{@dan, do you agree with this conclusion? it's opposite to your thesis, but I think this is the correct interpretation}

% In addition, we looked at the number of times the same word or phrase was pronounced by the same user. This data ranges from one single pronunciation to 14 pronunciations for the same word (phrase). The size of this interval is mostly due to the users' different proficiency in a certain language and the difficulty in pronunciation of the word (phrase) itself. Nevertheless, on average, the number approaches 1.66 pronunciation requests for the same piece of text, suggesting that users are generally sufficiently content with a pronunciation after hearing it the first time.


\feature{Undo}-ing a translation is used when the user wants to remove the last translation that was inserted in the text. For the proposed interaction mechanism this feature seems to be useful. 

A {\em like} button found at the bottom of an article  was clicked by the readers 174 times. Although not used at the moment, this information can be used in the future to improve article recommendations.
 % and maybe to add a social dimension to the system by providing information about how other people react to a given article.

The least used feature presented in the Figure \ref{fig:feature_usage}, {\em translation suggestion}, allows users to contribute their own translations when they are not satisfied with the one automatically provided by the system. 
% \ml{which brings me to: @Dan, what do you mean by alternatives here? :) Is it the number of times somebody selected an alternative, or the number of times they opened the menu. In any case, can we get the other number?}

  \begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{figures/reader_feature_usage_per_user}
    \caption{The usage of the various reader features by the various users }
    \label{fig:usage_per_user}
  \end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:usage_per_user} shows the number of distinct users for each category of events. A larger number of distinct users indicates a feature that is more important to the students. We see that: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item not all the users of the system use translations
  \item \feature{translation suggestion} is used by very few users. It still is to be determined whether this is due to readers overwhelmingly being satisfied with the automatic translations and their alternatives, or due to a low involvement. 
\end{itemize}

\section{How Do Students Use the Personalized Vocabulary Exercises?}

The system presented four types of vocabulary practice exercises to the students. In total, during the entire duration of the study we observed 18.082 exercises being presented to the students. Figure \ref{fig:ex_interactions} presents the number of exercises which had a ``correct'' outcome (red) vs. exercises which had a ``wrong'' outcome (blue). The figure shows one student who did 3.000 (!) exercises during one month, and about six over-eager students who did more than 700 exercises. 

  \begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/exercise_interactions_count.png}
    \caption{Correct (red) and wrong (blue) exercise outcomes per student}
    \label{fig:ex_interactions}
  \end{figure}

The figure does not include one other type of outcome, {\em requesting a hint}, which is presented in the table below grouped per exercise type. The corresponding number of hints suggests that the multiple-choice exercises (i.e. Match, Choose) are simpler than free text entry exercises (i.e. Find, Translate).

\begin{tabular}{lrrrr}
  % source id: 
  % choose -- 5
  % find -- 4
  % translate -- 7
  % match -- 6
                      & Choose  & Find & Translate & Match \\ \hline
  Total interactions  & 7180    & 6249 & 2643      & 2010\\
  Hint requests       & 29      & 529  & 847       & 16 \\ \hline
  \label{tab:hints_per_ex_type}
\end{tabular}

Figure \ref{fig:activity_per_day} shows the days when learners practice exercises. It suggests constant activity over the entire period of the study with a more intensive period towards the end.
