  The value of extensive reading can be found, besides the new words that are learned, in the strengthening of the knowledge of the existing words, increased fluency, and increased grammar knowledge. Some of these benefits can be reliably measured only after a time longer than our deployment \cite{renadya07-power}. 

  However, since our system combines free reading with vocabulary exercises and tracks all word interactions, by analyzing the learner interaction with the reader and the exercises\footnote{A more detailed analysis can be found elsewhere \cite{Avagyan17a-blocks}}, we can provide a glimpse into two measures of progress visible after one month of usage: increasing confidence about words and learning new words.

  Figure \ref{fig:word_learning_flow} summarizes the interactions of the students with words in the reader and the exercises. The figure is based on the analysis of the user interaction database and shows that: 

  \begin{itemize}
    \item From the 6,721 words that were looked up in the reader, 4,759 were used in the exercises platform. Since the learners requested a translation, they were either not sure about these words or did not know their meaning.

    \item More than 1,900 words were not practiced in the exercises. 
    Some did not get their turn to be scheduled by the algorithm and others were not presented because the system deemed them not fit for study (cf. Vocabulary Recommender, p.3). 
    % Given that not all the words can be practiced, this is an argument for prioritizing the words that the students are presented with in the exercises.

    \item For 3,626 words 
    % (76\% of all the words present in exercises) 
    the learners were able to correctly identify them the latest in the last associated exercise. Out of these: 

    \begin{itemize}
      \item 3,261 words 
      % (68\% of all the words in exercises) 
      were recognized already for the first time in the exercises. These are {\bf words likely to be strengthened by translating while reading}: the students were unsure when encountering them initially in the reader but eventually recognized their meaning when encountering them later in the exercises\footnote{It could also be that the students learned them after the first encounter in the text, but we keep the more conservative hypothesis}.  They represent 48\% of all the words that the students translated in the reader.

      \item 365 words 
      were wrong during their first exercise interaction but were correct in the final one. These {\bf words are likely to be learned via the exercises} by the students. \footnote{This number is conservative. We consider an answer to be correct only if it was right from the first attempt, without the use of a hint, and without typos.}

    \end{itemize}

  \item For 1,133 words 
  % (24\% of all the words present in exercises) 
  the outcome of the final exercise that involved was not a correct answer. Thus we assume that they were {\bf still not learned at the end of the experimental period}. Some of them might have been learned after the last exposure via the testing effect \cite{Roediger11-TestingEffect}, but we can not be sure.

  \end{itemize}
