The idea of augmenting texts with translations has been proposed before in various forms. One of the first occasions was in the work of Nerbonne \cite{Nerb99-Assistant} who propose Glosser -- system, which would provide dictionary information about a given word, including translation, part of speech, declinations. etc. In their work they focus on individual words; however, it is often the case that while reading a foreign text, a reader might want to translate a sequence of words. In a study with 22 people they observed users using the system for twenty minutes \cite{Dokter98-UserStudy}.

Azab et al. \cite{Azab13-nlp} have proposed a system entitled SmartReader which provides interactive annotations of English text in English for the foreign students who need help in that language. Their study introduces and describes the system, but does not report anything about the way the system is being used by users.
