  UPDATED---\today. 

 This paper describes the implementation and 
  deployment of a system that supports learners
  of a foreign language in reading materials that
  are personally interesting by allowing them to 
  read in an interactive reader news, blogs, and
  other materials from the internet. 

  The system provides translations for the unknown 
  words at the touch of the screen while at the same
  time 
      saving them in order to 
         be able to monitor the current state of the knowledge
          of the learner 
      and to later generate personalized exercises
        which are derived from the past readings of a user.

  This paper reports on the results of deploying the
  system for one month with \stcnt Dutch highschool students 
  learning French. 
  The students were very positive about the system, 
  and their teacher has decided to redeploy the sytem
  for the next academic year.
