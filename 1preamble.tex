  UPDATED---\today. 

 This paper describes the implementation and 
  deployment of a system that supports learners
  of a foreign language in reading materials that
  are personally interesting by allowing them to 
  read in an interactive reader news, blogs, and
  other materials from the internet. 
  
  The system provides translations for the unknown 
  words at the touch of the screen while at the same
  time monitoring the current state of the knowledge
  of the learner in order to be able to estimate the  
  texts of the appropriate difficulty.

  This paper reports on the results of deploying the
  system for one month with \stcnt Dutch highschool students 
  learning French. 
  The students were very positive about the system, 
  and their teacher has decided to redeploy the sytem
  for the next academic year.
