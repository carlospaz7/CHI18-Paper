\section{Limitations of the Study}
\label{sec:limitations}
% We presented a system, and we showed that it has the potential to generate user involvement. However the study we performed is not sufficient to reach a strong conclusion about the impact of the system we present... 

The feedback from the users was overall positive, with many of them showing appreciation for the personalization aspects of the system. 
However, further studies are needed since there are multiple reasons for which these results might not extend to the broader population. 
The students might have been influenced by our enthusiastic presentation of the system at the beginning of the testing month. 
Also, the students we worked with are not necessarily representative for the Dutch highschool student population since they are bilingual. 
% Even in this case, during the feedback multiple of them remarked that they would prefer to use the system in their native Dutch as opposed to English.
Also, the number of students who answered our survey was limited: only \surveyrespondents students which represents less than 50\% of the participants who actually used the system.

% We showed that the majority of the students used the system constantly throughout the one month period. 
% However, this might be because the students were encouraged to use the system as part of their assignment in the class. 
% If they used it only for the final grade, we would have expected a more focused cramming at the end of the period (which we actually saw with few of the students...). 


% We observed that students prefer to interact with different texts...  

The algorithms for scheduling vocabulary exercises are the state of the art in spaced repetition. However, we did not have a control group to see whether this approach works better than others. Moreover, note that other approaches for using spaced repetition already exist; what is unique in our approach is that the students learn based on personalized exercises generated based on the context of their past readings.

We showed that the student interaction with the texts indicates that at the end of the month they have learned words that they did not know at the begining. However, it is not clear whether this knowledge will remain for the long term. 


\section{Availability of System, Code and Data}

% \subsection{Software}
The system described in this paper is deployed and available online. If the readers of this article want to test it they can use the {\em CHI2018} invite code while following the  ``Become a Betatester'' link at \url{https://zeeguu.unibe.ch/}.

The source code is open under a MIT license and available online at \url{https://github.com/zeeguu-ecosystem}. The code is covered by tests and documentation. To replicate a study like the one presented in this paper with another population, a researcher can deploy their own version of the system. 

% \subsection{Data}
The anonymized telemetry data, representing the interactions of more than \students learners with the system for one month, is available as a MySQL database dump on GitHub at the following link: \url{https://github.com/zeeguu-ecosystem/CHI17-Paper}. The same link holds the full anonymized questionnaire data. % used in this paper.





\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We have presented here a system that we aimed to be a minimal viable product for a personalized language textbook that uses the web as its content source. We report on using the system with high school students for about one month. We observe that overall the students make use of the personalization features, and that by using the system their vocabulary is improved with new words and strenghened knowledge of words the were not sure about. 

When asked about it, the students appreciate the system, and in particular the possibility of reading personally interesting texts as well as the ease of interaction with the texts. They also want better ways to find even more personalized content. The teacher of the class thinks the such a system is critical for the modern language classroom, but wants more insight into student behavior.

We plan to work more with teachers to better understand how to combine the individuality of the system with the shared experience of the learners in a classroom. Other classroom workflows than the one presented here could be possible. 
% Indeed, new workflows and classroom activities must be discovered.

% We hope that the availability of the system, code, and the open data that we published will make it easy for other researchers to investigate problems related to 
% foreign language reading.
